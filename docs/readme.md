# PLL based Guitar Synth Pedal


## TODO

1. Remove J_CLEAN_IN1 input and C_CLEAN_IN1 cap. Remove SW_INSW1 (tie pins 3 and 1)
2. Confirm positions of SW_WAVE1 and SW_HOLD1 (they appear to be swapped)
3. Switching waveselect lowers volume. Is gain on sawtooth input that is too low? 
4. Replace waveselect switch with pot so that mix can be achieved between default square and integrated sq./sawtooth.
